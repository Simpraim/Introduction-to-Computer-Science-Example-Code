#Let's create a counter that counts to 5
a = 1
while a < 5: #While a is less than 5, do something...
 print(a)  #This is the something
 a = a + 1 #This changes the value of a so that you're not stuck in the loop
#Line 4 will execute, then line 5, then the interpreter will go to line 3
# with the new value of a (2 for example) and check if it is less than 5
# If a is NOT less than 5, lines 4 and 5 will not execute
